# Frogger
Made a java desktop game based on the arcade classic Frogger. This was a practice assignment dealing with object-oriented programming.

#Concept

Use arrow keys to move the 'frog' character left, right, up or down to avoid cars, and to stay safe from drowning by landing logs or crocodiles. Guide your character to the 5 lily-pads, where landing on all 5 advances you to the next level. You lose 1 life (starting with 3) when you get hit by a car or land in the river. Details on this arcade classic can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger">here</a>.

This project has 2 levels.
